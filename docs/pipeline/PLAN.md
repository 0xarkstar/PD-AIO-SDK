# PD-AIO-SDK Review & Improvement Pipeline

## Objective
Comprehensive review and improvement of the PD-AIO-SDK project — a unified TypeScript SDK for 13 decentralized perpetual exchanges.

## Baseline
- Version: 0.2.0
- Source files: 169 (.ts)
- Test files: 147 (.ts)
- Tests: 4538 passed, 1 failed (Lighter integration), 78 skipped
- TypeScript: Clean (0 errors)
- Test Suites: 126/130 passed

## Pipeline Phases

### [P-1] Research (Active)
- p-research-code: Deep codebase analysis — architecture, patterns, dead code, consistency
- p-research-docs: Documentation completeness — README, API.md, ARCHITECTURE.md accuracy
- p-research-best: Best practices audit — TypeScript, SDK design, testing patterns

### [P0] Design
- p-architect: Improvement plan with File Ownership Map
- p-critic: Design critique
- p-strategist: Test strategy for improvements

### [P0.5] Review (existing code)
- p-sec-reviewer: Security review
- p-perf-reviewer: Performance review
- p-cov-reviewer: Coverage analysis

### [P1] Implementation
- Based on P0 design

### [P2] Verification
- Hypothesis testing + QA
